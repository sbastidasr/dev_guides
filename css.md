top right bottom left

-Float: remain elements on the page. But, text wraps around them.
	Clear: Cleared elements go after floats.

-Static. Normal flow of the page
-Relative:What it really means is "relative to itself"But if you DO give it some other positioning attribute, say, top: 10px;, it will shift it's position 10 pixels DOWN from where it would NORMALLY be
-Fixed. This type of positioning is fairly rare but certainly has its uses. A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport,
--Absolutely positioned page elements are removed from the flow of the webpage,. Absolutely positioned page elements will not affect the position of other elements and other elements will not affect them
